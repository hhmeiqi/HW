1. I would prefer to use joins than subqueries since the query with join is faster than the query with subquery
2. A CTE can be used to: 
Create a recursive query.
Substitute for a view when the general use of a view is not required; that is, you do not have to store the definition in metadata.
Using a CTE offers the advantages of improved readability and ease in maintenance of complex queries. The query can be divided into separate, simple, logical building blocks. These simple blocks can then be used to build more complex, interim CTEs until the final result set is generated. 
CTEs can be defined in user-defined routines, such as functions, stored procedures, triggers, or views.
3. A table variable is a local variable that has some similarities to temp tables. Table variables are created via a declaration statement like other local variables. Within their scope, table variables can be used in SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements.
4. DELETE is DML command and TRUNCATE is DDL command. DELETE deletes records one by one and makes an entry for each and every deletion in the transaction log, whereas TRUNCATE de-allocates pages and makes an entry for de-allocation of pages in the transaction log.
Truncate reseeds identity values, whereas delete doesn't.
Truncate removes all records and doesn't fire triggers.
Truncate is faster compared to delete as it makes less use of the transaction log.
Truncate is not possible when a table is referenced by a Foreign Key or tables are used in replication or with indexed views.
5. An identity column is a column (also known as a field) in a database table that is made up of values generated by the database. 
6.To use the DELETE command you need DELETE permission for that table. TRUNCATE TABLE is similar to DELETE, but this operation is a DDL (Data Definition Language) command. It also deletes records from a table without removing table structure, but it doesnâ€™t use the WHERE clause.
